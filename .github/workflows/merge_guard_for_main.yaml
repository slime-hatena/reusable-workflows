        ⚠️ **Merge Guard Activated** ⚠️

        It looks like you're trying to merge a branch named \`${{ github.head_ref }}\` into \`main\`.
        To maintain a clean and stable \`main\` branch, please ensure that all changes are merged into \`develop\` or \`hotfix\` branches first. Once those branches are up-to-date and tested, you can then merge them into \`main\`.

        If you absolutely need to merge due to CI settings or an emergency, please start the title with \`[release skip]\`.

        Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! 🙏
